Q1.Find the time complexity for the following code snippet: 
   a = 1; 
   b = 1; 
   while(b <= n) 
	{ 
	  a = a + 1; 
	  b = b + a; 
	  cout<<"Hi"; 
	} 

Ans: T(n)=O(âˆšn)


Q2. Find the time complexity for the following code snippet: 
	for(i = n; i >= 1; i = i/3) 
	cout<<"Hi";

Ans: O(log n)
